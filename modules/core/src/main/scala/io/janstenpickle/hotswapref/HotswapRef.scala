/** A concurrent data structure that wraps a [[cats.effect.std.Hotswap]] providing access to `R` using a
  * [[cats.effect.kernel.Ref]], that is set on resource acquisition, while providing asynchronous hotswap functionality
  * via calls to [[swap]].
  *
  * In short, calls to [[swap]] do not block the usage of `R` via calls to [[access]].
  *
  * Repeated concurrent calls to [[swap]] are ordered by a semaphore to ensure that `R` doesn't churn unexpectedly.
  * As with calls to [[swap]] on [[cats.effect.std.Hotswap]], [[swap]] will block until the previous
  * [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] is finalized. Additionally open references to `R` are counted when it is accessed
  * via [[access]], any `R` with open references will block at finalization until all references are released, and
  * therefore subsequent calls to [[swap]] will block.

    * [[swap]] blocks, waiting for the previous [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] to finalize.
    *
    * This means that while there is previous no finalization process in progress when this is called, `R` may be
    * swapped in the ref, but will block until all references to `R` are removed and `R` is torn down.
    *
